This project will house all the extentions to get Domain.Identity hooked up and working,
including the Owin and Autofac bits.

This is meant to be a temporary project just to get everything together and working, but
it should be broken out into to Owin part and a DI framework independent part using
ISimpleRegistrationBuilder.
